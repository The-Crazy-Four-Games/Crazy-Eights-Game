    \begin{table}[h!]
        \caption{Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Goals} \label{TblMVPGoals}
        \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|X|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Explanation} & \textbf{Reasoning} \\
            \hline
            Two-Player Core Loop & Support a one-versus-one match with turn-taking, drawing, discarding, and win condition checks. Includes starter card, discard pile, and reshuffling the stock pile. & Two players represent the smallest playable unit. Completing this ensures the core gameplay is functional and testable. \\
            \hline
            Classic Rules Engine & Implement the standard Crazy Eights rules: match by suit or rank, “8” acts as wild, and drawing occurs if no valid move exists. & Ensuring correctness of the classic game establishes a solid baseline before adding variations. \\
            \hline
            Dozenal (Base-12) Scoring/Display & Display scores, counters, or thresholds in base-12 notation while keeping classic rules unchanged. & Introduces dozenal in a simple, non-disruptive way that highlights novelty while retaining accessibility. \\
            \hline
            Move Validation and Feedback & Provide immediate feedback for invalid moves, suit selection UI after playing an “8,” and clear state indicators. & Reduces errors, lowers learning curve, and improves user experience. \\
            \hline
            Testability and Determinism & Support seeded shuffling and provide basic logs or replays. & Facilitates unit/integration testing and reproducibility during evaluation. \\
            \hline
            Stability and Performance & Ensure responsive UI (<200ms), no crashes, no deadlocks, and correct reshuffling. & Reliability is the baseline for acceptance and live demonstration. \\
            \hline
            Minimal UI & Provide a desktop or web interface showing hand, discard pile, current state, and dozenal score tracker. & Covers essential user interactions while limiting complexity at MVP stage. \\
            \hline
        \end{tabularx}
    \end{table}

    \section{Stretch Goals}

    \begin{table}[h!]
        \caption{Stretch Goals} \label{TblStretchGoals}
        \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|X|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Explanation} & \textbf{Reasoning} \\
            \hline
            3–4 Player Matches & Extend gameplay to support three or more players in a single match. & Crazy Eights is often played with more than two people, which increases replayability. \\
            \hline
            Online Multiplayer & Allow players to create/join rooms and synchronize state across network connections. & Brings the game closer to real-world usage and demonstrates system design capability. \\
            \hline
            Advanced Dozenal Variants & Add optional rule packs where cards related to 12 gain special effects or scoring thresholds use base-12 values. & Deepens the dozenal theme while keeping the classic mode intact. \\
            \hline
            Rule Configurator & Provide toggles for house rules such as stacking eights or alternate scoring methods. & Demonstrates variability management and supports experimentation. \\
            \hline
            Tutorial and Visual Guidance & Include first-game tutorial, invalid-move highlights, and play suggestions. & Lowers the learning curve and improves usability. \\
            \hline
            Save/Replay System & Allow saving and replaying completed games. & Supports debugging, user study, and richer documentation. \\
            \hline
            Cross-Platform Packaging & Deploy as a web app or desktop executable. & Lowers barrier for evaluators and external users to try the system. \\
            \hline
        \end{tabularx}
