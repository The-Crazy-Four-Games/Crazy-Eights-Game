        \caption{MVP Functional Goals}\label{TblMVPFunctionalGoals}
        \begin{tabular}{|p{0.22\textwidth}|p{0.46\textwidth}|p{0.28\textwidth}|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Explanation} & \textbf{Reasoning} \\
            \hline
            Two-Player Core Loop &
            Support a one-versus-one match with turn-taking, drawing, discarding, and win checks. Includes starter card, discard pile, and reshuffling the stock pile. &
            Two players are the smallest playable unit; finishing this proves the core loop. \\
            \hline
            Classic Rules Engine &
            Implement standard Crazy Eights: match by suit or rank; an ``8'' is wild and lets the player declare a suit; draw if no valid move exists. &
            Correct classic rules establish a solid baseline before adding variations. \\
            \hline
            Dozenal (Base-12) Scoring/Display &
            Display scores, counters, or thresholds in base-12 notation while keeping classic rules unchanged. &
            Introduces dozenal in a simple, non-disruptive way that highlights novelty while retaining accessibility. \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

            \textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Explanation} & \textbf{Reasoning} \\
            \hline
            Move Validation and Feedback &
            Provide immediate invalid-move feedback, clear suit selection UI after playing an ``8,'' and real-time state indicators. &
            Reduces errors and learning curve; improves usability. \\
            \hline
            Testability and Determinism &
            Support seeded shuffling and provide basic logs or replays for each session. &
            Enables reproducible unit/integration testing and debugging. \\
            \hline
            Stability and Performance &
            Ensure responsive UI \(<200\,\text{ms}\), no crashes, no deadlocks, and correct reshuffling. &
            Reliability is the baseline for acceptance and live demonstration. \\
            \hline
            Minimal UI &
            Provide a desktop~or web interface showing hand, discard pile, current state, and a dozenal score tracker. &
            Covers essential interactions while limiting complexity at the MVP stage. \\
            \hline

            \hline
            Advanced Dozenal Variants &
            Optional rule packs (e.g., effects for 12-related cards; base-12 scoring thresholds such as \(60_{12}\)). &
            Deepens the dozenal theme while keeping the classic mode intact. \\

    \section{Extras}

    \section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{What went well while writing this deliverable?} \\
        Our team collaborated effectively to define the scope of the project. We were able to clearly separate functional goals (gameplay features) and non-functional goals (quality attributes) after reviewing the lecture guidance. The use of LaTeX tables also helped us present goals in a structured and consistent format. Team communication through version control (Git) went smoothly, and everyone contributed ideas.

        \item \textbf{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?} \\
        One major challenge was formatting issues in LaTeX, especially with long text wrapping inside tables and ensuring that columns aligned properly. We also struggled at first with distinguishing between functional and non-functional goals, since some goals could be interpreted as both. These issues were resolved by researching LaTeX table packages, adjusting column widths, and reviewing lecture notes and examples for proper classification. Another pain point was Git conflicts during merges, which we resolved by carefully rebasing and keeping frequent communication.

        \item \textbf{How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?} \\
        Initially, we considered including multiple advanced rule variants and a fully-featured online multiplayer system in the MVP. However, we realized this would be too ambitious for the timeline. Instead, we limited the MVP to a two-player local game with classic rules and base-12 scoring. More complex features, such as AI opponents and online multiplayer, were moved to the stretch goals. This adjustment ensures that the MVP is achievable while still leaving room for meaningful extensions to demonstrate complexity.

        \item \textbf{How did you handle version control and collaboration challenges?} \\
        At first, there was some confusion with branching and merging in Git. By agreeing on a workflow (feature branches merged into main through pull requests) and keeping commit messages clear, we reduced conflicts and improved traceability of changes.

        \item \textbf{How will this deliverable guide your next steps in the project?} \\
        The problem statement and goals document provides a shared roadmap for the team. It will serve as a reference point when making design decisions and prioritizing features, especially if scope adjustments are needed later in the term.
