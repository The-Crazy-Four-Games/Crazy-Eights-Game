\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The purpose of this project is to design and implement an educational card game based on the traditional \textit{Crazy 8s} rule set, but adapted to integrate the \textbf{Dozenal (base-12) number system}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item This project addresses the lack of accessible and engaging tools that introduce alternative number systems in a playful and intuitive way.
    \item By combining a familiar card game mechanic with Dozenal representations and operations, users can gradually build comfort and intuition with the base-12 system.
    \item The primary business value lies in providing a lightweight, fun, and interactive educational tool for students, hobbyists, and anyone interested in number systems beyond decimal.
\end{itemize}
Additionally, the game offers an opportunity to evaluate how gamification can support mathematical learning, and whether abstract concepts (such as base conversions or divisibility in Dozenal) can be effectively taught through play.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
The goals of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Educational Integration: Seamlessly incorporate Dozenal concepts (symbols 0--B, factorization, arithmetic) into the gameplay, ensuring that players learn by playing without requiring formal prior knowledge.
    \item Gameplay Design: Deliver a working digital version of \textit{Crazy 8s} that is intuitive, responsive, and enjoyable, while maintaining the familiar flow of the original game and introducing Dozenal-specific mechanics (e.g., matching rules, scoring, or special cards).
    \item Accessibility and Engagement: Create a user-friendly interface that lowers the barrier to learning, accessible for casual users while offering depth for learners who want to explore Dozenal further.
    \item Scalability / Stretch Goals: Explore the potential for extending the system to other educational card or board games, and investigate how different number bases can be taught through similar game mechanics.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}

The current numerical system used around the world is predominantly decimal (base-10). This system, while widely adopted, has limitations in representing fractions cleanly, as its prime factors (2 and 5) result in recurring decimals for simple ratios 1/3 or 1/6. On the other hand, the dozenal (base-12) system, with divisors 2, 3, 4, and 6, offers a more intuitive and concise fraction representations, historically used in trade and measurement systems (e.g., dozens, hours). However, dozenal is underutilized in education and practice, leaving students, educators, and professionals reliant on decimal despite its inefficiencies for certain calculations. There is no current fun and engaging way to demonstrate the practical advantages of dozenal, such as a card game like Crazy Eights, to promote its adoption.

\subsection{The Context of the Work}

The project focuses on the software implementation of the Crazy Eights card game that incorporates dozenal (base-12) scoring and display to highlight the benefits of the dozenal system. The context includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Educational Context}: The project will simplify mathematical understanding for the user by showing dozenal's advantages in a familiar and fun game format.
    \item \textbf{Technical Context}: The software will be developed using a modern tech stack for web applications (JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL) and use GitHub CI/CD pipelines for version control and testing.
    \item \textbf{Stakeholder Context}: Key stakeholders include students, educators, mathematicians, computer scientists, and the general public, all of whom could benefit from clearer fraction representations and easier mental arithmetic.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Work Partitioning}

The workload is divided into the following major phases, aligned with the development plan:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Problem Definition and Planning (Weeks 3--4)}: Draft problem statement, development plan, and initial proof of concept (PoC) to establish scope and feasibility.
    \item \textbf{Requirements and Hazard Analysis (Week 6)}: Develop the SRS and identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.
    \item \textbf{Verification and Validation Planning (Week 8)}: Define testing strategies to ensure the software meets functional and non-functional requirements.
    \item \textbf{System Design (Weeks 10--16)}: Create and refine architecture diagrams, decompose the system into modules (frontend, backend, database, API), and document extensibility.
    \item \textbf{Implementation and Testing (Weeks 11--19)}: Develop the MVP (two-player game with classic rules and dozenal scoring), conduct unit and integration testing, and prepare for demonstrations.
    \item \textbf{Demonstrations and Refinement (Weeks 19--24)}: Conduct Revision 0 and final demonstrations, incorporating feedback to improve functionality and performance.
    \item \textbf{Final Documentation and EXPO (Week 26)}: Finalize documentation and present a polished product at the EXPO.
\end{enumerate}

Each task is tracked via GitHub Issues and the Kanban board, with responsibilities assigned to team members based on rotating roles (developer, reviewer, meeting chair, note-taker).

\subsection{Specifying a Business Use Case (BUC)}

\textbf{BUC: Play a Game of Crazy Eights with Dozenal Scoring}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Actors}: Two players, the software system.
    \item \textbf{Trigger}: A player creates a new game session using the UI.
    \item \textbf{Description}: Two players take turns matching cards by suit or rank, with the ``8'' card acting as a wild card that allows the player to declare a new suit. If no valid move can be made, the player draws from the stock pile. The game ends when one player discards all their cards, and the score is calculated and displayed in dozenal notation.
    \item \textbf{Preconditions}: The user is logged in. The software is running on a web interface, with a functional UI displaying the hand, discard pile, stock pile, and score tracker.
    \item \textbf{Postconditions}: The game concludes with a winner, points are displayed in dozenal and must be counted by the users to see the final score. The user can log Off or start a new game.
    \item \textbf{Basic Flow}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The system deals cards to both players and initializes the discard pile with a starter card.
        \item Players take turns, selecting a card to play (matching suit or rank) or drawing from the stock pile.
        \item If an ``8'' is played, the player selects a new suit via the UI.
        \item The system checks moves and gives immediate feedback for invalid moves.
        \item The game keeps going until one player has no cards left, triggering user score counting and calculation challenge in dozenal.
        \item The system displays the final score.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Exceptions}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Invalid move attempted: The system highlights the error and prompts the player to select a valid card or draw.
        \item Stock pile exhausted: The system reshuffles the discard pile to replenish the stock pile.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Assumptions}: Players are familiar with basic card game mechanics and the system supports a stable internet connection for play.
\end{itemize}
