\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The purpose of this project is to design and implement an educational card game based on the traditional \textit{Crazy 8s} rule set, but adapted to integrate the \textbf{Dozenal (base-12) number system}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item This project addresses the lack of accessible and engaging tools that introduce alternative number systems in a playful and intuitive way.
    \item By combining a familiar card game mechanic with Dozenal representations and operations, users can gradually build comfort and intuition with the base-12 system.
    \item The primary business value lies in providing a lightweight, fun, and interactive educational tool for students, hobbyists, and anyone interested in number systems beyond decimal.
\end{itemize}
Additionally, the game offers an opportunity to evaluate how gamification can support mathematical learning, and whether abstract concepts (such as base conversions or divisibility in Dozenal) can be effectively taught through play.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
The goals of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Educational Integration: Seamlessly incorporate Dozenal concepts (symbols 0--B, factorization, arithmetic) into the gameplay, ensuring that players learn by playing without requiring formal prior knowledge.
    \item Gameplay Design: Deliver a working digital version of \textit{Crazy 8s} that is intuitive, responsive, and enjoyable, while maintaining the familiar flow of the original game and introducing Dozenal-specific mechanics (e.g., matching rules, scoring, or special cards).
    \item Accessibility and Engagement: Create a user-friendly interface that lowers the barrier to learning, accessible for casual users while offering depth for learners who want to explore Dozenal further.
    \item Scalability / Stretch Goals: Explore the potential for extending the system to other educational card or board games, and investigate how different number bases can be taught through similar game mechanics.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Product}

\subsection{Product Boundary}
The product to be developed is a digital card game application based on the traditional \textit{Crazy 8s} rules, modified to integrate the \textbf{Dozenal (base-12) number system}.
The system boundary includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A game engine that supports core Crazy 8s mechanics (drawing, discarding, turn-taking, winning conditions).
    \item Adaptations of rules, card values, and scoring to incorporate Dozenal arithmetic and representations.
    \item A user interface allowing players to interact with the game (play cards, view scores, receive feedback).
    \item Educational prompts or visual aids to help players understand Dozenal concepts.
\end{itemize}
External systems not included in the boundary are: general learning platforms, multiplayer servers beyond basic peer-to-peer/local play, and integrations with unrelated educational tools.

\subsection{Individual Product Use Cases (PUCs)}

\noindent\textbf{UC1: Start a New Game}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Player opens the application and selects ``New Game''.
    \item The system initializes a Dozenal-enabled deck (0--B, 10).
    \item The system shuffles the deck.
    \item The system deals cards to each player.
    \item The game state is displayed on the interface.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{UC2: Take a Turn}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system indicates that it is the playerâ€™s turn.
    \item The player chooses either to play a card or to draw from the deck.
    \item If the player chooses a card, the system checks its validity against the discard pile.
    \item If valid, the card is placed onto the discard pile.
    \item If invalid, the system notifies the player and the card remains in the hand.
    \item If the player chooses to draw, the system gives one card from the deck to the player.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{UC3: Validate Move}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The player selects a card to play.
    \item The system retrieves the top card from the discard pile.
    \item The system checks if the move is legal under Dozenal rules:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item same suit, or
        \item same Dozenal value, or
        \item sum of the two values equals 12 (base-12).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item If the move is legal, the system accepts the card and updates the discard pile.
    \item If not, the system rejects the move and notifies the player.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{UC4: View Scores}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A round ends or the player requests to view scores.
    \item The system calculates points for each player.
    \item The system converts the scores into both decimal and Dozenal.
    \item The system displays the results on screen.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{UC5: Provide Hints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The player hovers over or selects a card.
    \item The system analyzes the current game state.
    \item The system provides a hint (e.g., ``This card is valid because its sum with the top card equals 12 (base-12).'').
    \item The hint is displayed as text or a visual highlight.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{UC6: End Game}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A player discards their last card.
    \item The system checks if the game-ending condition is satisfied.
    \item If satisfied, the system declares the winner.
    \item The system calculates final scores in both decimal and Dozenal.
    \item The results are displayed on the final game screen.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Game Manager}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Start new game:} Game manager shall allow the player to start a new Crazy 8s game with a Dozenal-enabled deck. (FR-1) \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Players need a way to initialize the game state; starting a new game is the foundation for all other gameplay functions.

    \item \textbf{Turn management:} Game manager shall manage player turns, ensuring that each player either discards a valid card or draws a card. (FR-2) \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Turn-taking enforces fairness and ensures game flow consistency.

    \item \textbf{Rule validation:} Game manager shall validate that each played card is legal under Dozenal rules. A valid move is defined as either: (a) same suit as the previous card, (b) same Dozenal value as the previous card, or (c) the sum of the two card values equals 12 in Dozenal. (FR-3) \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Prevents illegal moves, guarantees consistency, and introduces the core educational mechanic of Dozenal arithmetic.

    \item \textbf{Special cards:} Game manager shall implement special card effects (e.g., 8s are wild) while supporting extensions with Dozenal-specific effects. (FR-4) \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Special cards increase engagement and add flexibility in teaching Dozenal-based rules.

    \item \textbf{End of game:} Game manager shall determine when the game ends (e.g., when a player runs out of cards) and declare the winner. (FR-5) \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} A clear end condition is required for meaningful gameplay and reinforcement of learning objectives.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Score Manager}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Calculate score:} Score manager shall calculate points for each round in both decimal and Dozenal. (FR-6) \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Displaying scores in both systems reinforces learning by encouraging comparison between familiar decimal and new Dozenal formats.

    \item \textbf{Display score:} Score manager shall display both decimal and Dozenal results on the user interface. (FR-7) \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Visual feedback supports player understanding and helps users internalize Dozenal representations.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Education Support}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hints:} System shall provide hints or explanations when a player performs an action involving Dozenal arithmetic. (FR-8) \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} On-demand guidance lowers the learning curve and supports players with varying levels of familiarity.

    \item \textbf{Highlight valid moves:} System shall visually highlight valid moves based on Dozenal rules. (FR-9) \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Reduces frustration, ensures players stay engaged, and reinforces Dozenal rules through visual learning.
\end{enumerate}
