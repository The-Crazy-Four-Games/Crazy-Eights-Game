\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

This section defines end to end system tests that validate the software against the SRS Functional Requirements (FR-1..FR-9) for the MVP implementation state. Tests are grouped by related functionality to improve traceability and reuse of fixtures. Unless stated otherwise, tests assume a deterministic deck seed, two authenticated test users, and a clean database. All expected results are observable via the UI and server state exposed to the test harness.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

The subsections below cover: (1) game flow, rule validation, special cards, and end conditions (SRS Game Manager: FR-1..FR-5) and (2) scoring and education features including dual-base display, hints, and valid move highlighting (SRS Score Manager and Education Support: FR-6..FR-9). Where tests rely on input constraints, they use the card value and move legality definitions in the SRS.

\subsubsection{Game Manager: Start, Turn, Rules, Specials, End (FR-1..FR-5)}

This area verifies new game initialization, turn sequencing, rule validation for same suit or same value or sum equals 12 (base-12), handling of wild eights, and detecting the end of a game. It directly traces to FR-1 Start new game, FR-2 Turn management, FR-3 Rule validation, FR-4 Special cards, FR-5 End of game.

\paragraph{Start new game initializes state (ST-GM-01)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-GM-01\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: No active sessions. Two users are authenticated and in the lobby. Deterministic deck seed S is configured.
					
Input: User A clicks New Game and invites User B. User B accepts.					
					
Output: A new session is created with a shuffled deck using seed S, a discard starter card is placed, each player receives the configured hand size H, and the UI shows turn = User A.

Test Case Derivation: From FR-1 and SRS deck initialization semantics. With a fixed seed S, the initial state is uniquely determined.

How test will be performed: Run a Node console harness that calls initGame('S'), then logs and checks via simple equality that hands have size H, discard.length == 1, and turn == UserA. No browser, no sockets.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Legal move: same suit (ST-GM-02)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-GM-02\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: Active session. Discard top = 5$\heartsuit$. User A hand contains K$\heartsuit$ and others. Turn = User A.
					
Input: User A plays K$\heartsuit$.
					
Output: Move is accepted. Discard top becomes K$\heartsuit$. Turn advances to User B.

Test Case Derivation: FR-3 allows a move when suits match.

How test will be performed: In the console harness set discard = [{suit:'H',v:5}] and handA contains K$\heartsuit$. Call canPlay() then playCard(). Log PASS if top becomes K$\heartsuit$ and turn flips to UserB.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Legal move: sum equals 12 (base-12) (ST-GM-03)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-GM-03\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: Discard top = 5$\diamondsuit$ (value 5). User A hand contains 7$\spadesuit$ (value 7). Turn = User A.
					
Input: User A plays 7$\spadesuit$.
					
Output: Move is accepted. Discard top becomes 7$\spadesuit$. Turn advances to User B.

Test Case Derivation: In base-12, 5 + 7 = 10$_{12}$ which equals 12 in decimal. FR-3 permits play when values sum to 12 base-12.

How test will be performed: Set top to value 5 then attempt to play value 7. Use canPlay() to assert true and log PASS.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Special card: wild eight suit selection (ST-GM-04)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-GM-04\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: Discard top = K$\clubsuit$. User A hand contains 8$\heartsuit$. Turn = User A.
					
Input: User A plays 8$\heartsuit$ and selects Spades as the new suit.
					
Output: Move is accepted. Discard shows 8 with chosen suit indicator = Spades. Only Spades or otherwise legal responses are allowed for the next player.

Test Case Derivation: FR-4 specifies 8s are wild and allow the player to declare a suit.

How test will be performed: Give A an 8, play with playCard(state,'A',eight,{chooseSuit:'S'}), then check chosenSuit == 'S' and turn == 'B' via console logs.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Illegal move is rejected with guidance (ST-GM-05)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-GM-05\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: Discard top = 9$\diamondsuit$. User A hand contains Q$\clubsuit$ and no other legal card.
					
Input: User A attempts to play Q$\clubsuit$.
					
Output: Move is rejected. UI shows polite message explaining why the move is invalid and highlights available actions: draw or play a legal card if any.

Test Case Derivation: FR-3 rejects moves that are not same suit, not same value, and do not sum to 12 base-12.

How test will be performed: Call canPlay() on an invalid card and expect false. For now we just assert the engine rejects the move; UI message will be verified later in UI tests.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{End of game detection (ST-GM-06)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-GM-06\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: User A has 1 card, which is legal to play. User B has multiple cards.
					
Input: User A plays the last card.
					
Output: Game ends. Winner = User A. System transitions to score calculation and displays results.

Test Case Derivation: FR-5 requires ending the game when a player has no cards left.

How test will be performed: Have a script a state where A has one legal card, call playCard(), then log PASS if state.status == 'Completed' and winner == 'A'.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Score and Education Features: Dual-base, Hints, Highlights (FR-6..FR-9)}

This area validates round scoring in decimal and Dozenal, correct conversion and display, context explanations for Dozenal arithmetic, and visual highlighting of valid moves. It traces to FR-6 Calculate score, FR-7 Display score, FR-8 Hints, FR-9 Highlight valid moves.

\paragraph{Score calculated and shown in decimal and Dozenal (ST-SC-01)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-SC-01\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: Game just ended. Opponent remaining cards have numeric values 2, 4, 6 (per SRS value function).
					
Input: Trigger score calculation screen.
					
Output: Decimal total = 12. Dozenal total = 10$_{12}$. Both are displayed side by side.

Test Case Derivation: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 decimal which equals 10 in base-12.

How test will be performed: Call calculateScore({B:[2,4,6]}) and expect { decimal:12, dozenal:'10' }. Log PASS/FAIL.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Dozenal explanation for sum equals 12 move (ST-SC-02)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-SC-02\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: Discard top = 5. Hover help is enabled.					
Input: Player hovers a 7 in hand and then selects it.
					
Output: Hint appears: explanation that 5 + 7 = 10$_{12}$ which equals 12 decimal, therefore the move is valid.

Test Case Derivation: FR-8 requires on demand guidance for Dozenal arithmetic.

How test will be performed: For MVP engine tests, only assert the explanation function returns a string containing 5 + 7 = $10_{12}$. UI tooltip will be covered later.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Valid moves highlighted exactly (ST-SC-03)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-SC-03\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: Discard top = 4$\spadesuit$. Hand contains 4$\clubsuit$, 8$\diamondsuit$, 7$\heartsuit$, Q$\spadesuit$, 6$\clubsuit$.
					
Input: None beyond rendering the hand.
					
Output: Highlighted cards are exactly \{4$\clubsuit$, Q$\spadesuit$, 8$\diamondsuit$\}. 7$\heartsuit$ and 6$\clubsuit$ are not highlighted.

Test Case Derivation: Same value (4), same suit (Spades), and wild eight are valid. Others are invalid because 7 + 4 = 11 decimal which is not 10$_{12}$ and 6 + 4 = 10 decimal which is not 10$_{12}$.

How test will be performed: Call an exported listValidMoves(state, hand) and assert it returns exactly the IDs for same value, same suit, and wild eight. Log PASS/FAIL.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Primary base toggle affects labeling only (ST-SC-04)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-SC-04\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: Score view shows decimal on the left and Dozenal on the right with decimal as primary.
					
Input: Toggle primary base to Dozenal.
					
Output: Labels and prominence swap, but numeric values remain identical pair \{12, 10$_{12}$\}. No recomputation changes total values.

Test Case Derivation: FR-7 specifies dual display; the toggle is a presentation choice.

How test will be performed: For MVP engine tests, verify the conversion outputs are stable. The UI toggle is deferred; assert that conversion of 12 dec remains $10_{12}$ before and after calling a setPrimaryBase() no-op stub.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
