\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the POC
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the beginning of the term
and the POC demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

\subsection*{Overview}
The POC demo will be performed in-person and run locally from a group member's laptop. The goal is to demonstrate the core gameplay mechanics and an end-to-end 1v1 game flow.

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Start the local server (\texttt{Node.js} terminal server) on the presenter's machine.
	\item Use the hard-coded two-player configuration (no authentication for the POC).
	\item Open the game in a browser on the presenter machine.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Demo flow (approx. 5--7 minutes)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Brief introduction of demo objective (30s).
	\item Show initial game state: deck creation and hands dealt to both players.
	\item Two team members will control each player and demonstrate gameplay:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Playing cards from a hand.
			\item Demonstrating matching logic (suit, rank, and add-to-10 rule).
			\item Demonstrating wildcard logic (changing the suit).
			\item Demonstrating drawing a card when no valid plays are available.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Drive the game to an endgame state and show the end condition.
	\item Conclude with limitations and next steps, then take questions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item No login/authentication is required for this POC demo.
	\item Will mention current limitations (hard-coded users, basic UI) and planned next steps.
\end{itemize}


\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Name 1 & Num\\
Name 2 & Num\\

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

\noindent \textbf{Supervisor's Name: } [fill in this information]

\section{Lecture Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many lectures have they attended over the time
period of interest.  This number should be determined from the lecture issues in
the team's repo. You can find the number of lectures in the time period of
interest by looking at the

{Google calendar} for the capstone course.}

\wss{NOTE: There will be approximately 13 lectures between the start of class
and the POC demos}

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many of the informal document discussion meetings
with the TA were attended over the time period of interest.}

\section{Commits}

\wss{For each team member how many commits to the main branch have been made
over the time period of interest.  The total is the total number of commits for
the entire team since the beginning of the term.  The percentage is the
percentage of the total commits made by each team member.}

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\

Name 3 & Num & \% \\
Name 4 & Num & \% \\
Name 5 & Num & \% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.  For
instance, if a team member has more commits to unmerged branches, these numbers
can be provided here.  If multiple people contribute to a commit, git allows for
multi-author commits.}

\section{Issue Tracker}

\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}

\begin{table}[H]

\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

\wss{Provide a summary of the quantified triggers identified in the team's
charter.}

\wss{Provide a list of any violations of the triggers.  If the team wishes, the
violations can be summarized on aggregate, instead of naming specific team
members.}

\wss{Provide a plan to address the violations.  This could include revising the
triggers, if they are found to be too weak, strong or ambiguous.}

\section{Additional Productivity Metrics}
